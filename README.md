# Graph Filer
- Sci fi? You must have seen science fiction movies where the user zooms into their files it feels like a graph. I've wanted this feature for years now and I finally managed to make it!!!
- Here's something I am really proud of.
- Demo : open the html file :)
> Note: Please use chrome

- If you've made it this far. Let me tell you the funny part.
- I made this using a graph plotting library in Python. Hacked using JavaScript.
